# jesse-eisenberg - Social Network API

## Descricption:

This application is an API for a social networking app. There is no front-end so far, so this application is strictly back-end based right now and relies on testing routes through Insomnia. This API allows users to create, update, and delete a user while also being able to add and remove friends from their "Friends List". This API also allows users to create, update, and delete "thoughts" where other users can add and remove "reactions" to those thoughts.

## Installation:

To install this application, you will have to clone the repository from my GitHub and then open it in a platform like VS Code. Once inside VS Code, you will want to run "npm i" in the command-line to install all the packages you will need. After that, you can run "npm run start" and it will create your database using MongoDB/Mongoose and get your server up and running, and then you can test all the routes using an application like Insomnia

## Usage:

The main usage of this application is to allow developers to have access to a social network API that is easy-to-use and ready to plug-and-play. It allows developers to create, read, update, and delete data of Users, Thoughts, Reactions, and Friends. Which are all essential starting points for any social netwroking application.
